Hello there! If you've stumbled across this site, or been referred here, feel free to take a look around. I've developed this site as a personal reference as well as a way to formalize some of the work I pursue in the mobile robotics and autonomous vehicles domain. Much of what you find here is likely to be machine vision related, but the topics will be updated as I need them. If you have any questions or just want to share what you're working on yourself, send me an email and I'll respond as I'm able.

I'll also be including write-ups on training sessions I take and hopefully that will be useful to those of you looking to expand your own education.
